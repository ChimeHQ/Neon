# ``Neon``

A Swift library for efficient, flexible content-based text styling.

## Overview

Neon originally was extracted from the syntax highlighting system of [Chime][https://github.com/ChimeHQ/Chime]. Since then, it has envolved over time. It is still very well-suited to syntax highlighting. But, it is now a much more general-purpose content state management system. If you need to mantain state based on a linear range of data, even if that data doesn't come from TextKit, Neon probably has a component that could help.
